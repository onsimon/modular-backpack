## BOM

### Printed parts

* **Important:** Printed parts not yet rotated for printing! Use your best judgement and reorient where needed. 
* Voron parts naming standard and print settings. It should be safe to do 0.6 line width and 3 perimiters for a bit faster print times.
* Alternatives prefixed with a double dash `--` meaning that you pick one of the variations for each prefix.
* You need to print a base + a lid with an optional logo + duct parts for your printer size.
